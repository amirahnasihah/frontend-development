How does the Internet work? 🧐

Given two situations which called simple network and network of networks.

1. Simple network 💻📲
Two computers need to communicate, you link them, either physically (usually with an Ethernet cable) or wirelessly (for example with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth systems).

Try connecting your smartphone to a laptop using a cable to get media files (images, videos etc.)

2. Network of networks ⛓️
If you want to connect to hundreds, or thousands of computers to places outside your home, you need a modem to connect to the telephone infrastructure before connecting your network to an Internet Service Provide (ISP). So, the message from your local network is carried through the network of ISP to the destination network.

This infrastructure of networks is what makes an Internet. 📡
