# Introduction

Welcome to our Coding Interview Practice Questions Module!

As experienced practitioners in the industry, we understand the importance of practical coding skills and theoretical knowledge before heading into the job interview room. That's why we have created this course to help you prepare for your coding interviews.

During this course, you would not see any lecture videos or notes. Instead, you will have access to an online coding exercise that will challenge you to solve interview coding problems. You will also have access to a multiple-choice quiz that will assess your theoretical knowledge of computer science concepts. These exercises are designed to test your proficiency in JavaScript, algorithms, and data structures.

Practicing these exercises will not only improve your coding skills and knowledge, but also help you gain confidence in your abilities to tackle coding challenges during your interviews. It is essential to note that coding interviews often involve practical coding tasks and theoretical questions, so mastering these exercises will prepare you for the real interviews.

I encourage you to take advantage of this module and use it as a tool to improve your skills and knowledge. Best of luck in your preparations!

## How to leverage the exercises

In order to get the most out of this module, it is important to use the exercises in the right way. Here are some tips on how to use these exercises:

1.	Avoid copying and pasting answers from the internet. While it may be tempting to take the easy way out, you will not learn anything from doing this. It is important to work through the exercises yourself and try to solve the problems on your own.

2.	Make sure you understand each question before moving on to the next one. Take your time and read through the instructions carefully. After completion of a question, make sure you re-read your answer and make sure you understand why your solution would work. If you are unsure about something, don't hesitate to reach out to your mentors or peers for clarification.

3.	When in doubt, talk to the mentors. Our mentors are here to help you navigate through the exercises and answer any questions you may have. Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.

4.	Use these exercises as a checklist for identifying your shortcomings. After completing the exercises, take some time to review your work and identify areas where you were struggling or not so sure about. Once you have identified your weaknesses, focus on reviewing those topics and practicing until you feel confident with them.

By using these exercises, you will be able to identify areas for improvements and prepare yourself for your coding interviews. Good luck!
