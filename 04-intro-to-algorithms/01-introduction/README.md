# Brute Force and Recursion

## Part 1 Coding a brute force search algorithm

In this part, you are going to try coding a brute force algorithm for searching a target in an array.

Open `exercise-1.js` file and please finish the find function according to the specification in the file. We have prepared some test cases for you to test your functions.

## Part 2 Coding a factorial function using recursion technique

In this part, you are going to try implementing a factorial function using a recursion algorithm. Make sure that you are using the recursion technique instead of a simple for loop.

Open `exercise-2.js` file and please finish the find function according to the specification in the file. We have prepared some test cases for you to test your functions.
