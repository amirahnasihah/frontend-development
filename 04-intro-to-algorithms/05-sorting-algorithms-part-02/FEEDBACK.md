# FEEDBACK

1. Task 1 (Score: 85)

Great job on writing the code for the Merge sort algorithm! 

The implementation looks good and the code runs without any errors. The logic you used to sort the array is also correct. However, you can **improve your code by adding a check to ensure that the input array is not null or undefined, as the current implementation does not handle such cases.**

2. Task 2

For the task 2, I will suggest you to **avoid unnecessary array swaps**. In the partition function, you swap the pivot element with the element at `arr[i + 1]`. While this works correctly, it is not necessary because the pivot is already at the correct position. **Consider removing the swap operation to make the code more efficient**.

Overall, great job on the implementation and passing all test cases! Keep up the good work.
