## What is Algorithm?

Algorithm:

- A methodology to solve problem, a description of the steps to solve a problem
- The focus is not about “coding”, but the “thinking”
- There are no formulas, but some common way of thinking about a problem
- Practice more and read more is the best way to improve your skills
