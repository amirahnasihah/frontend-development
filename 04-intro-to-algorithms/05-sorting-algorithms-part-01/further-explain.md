# Sorting Algorithm

# Bubble Sort

Pseudocode example #1:

```
Set swap counter to a non-zero value
Repeat until the swap counter is equal to 0:
    Reset swap counter to 0
    Look at each adjacent pair:
        If two adjacent elements are not in order:
            Swap them
            Add one to the swap counter
```

Pseudocode example #2:

```
Repeat until no swaps
    For i from 0 to nâ€“2
        If i'th and i+1'th elements out of order
            Swap them
```
