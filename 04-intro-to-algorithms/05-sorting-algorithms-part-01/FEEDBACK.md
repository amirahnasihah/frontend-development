1. Task 1 (Score: 85)

Great job on writing the code for bubble sort! 

The implementation looks good and the code runs without any errors. The logic you used to sort the array using bubble sort is also correct. However, you can improve your code by adding a check to ensure that the input array is not null or undefined, as the current implementation does not handle such cases.

Additionally, the code could be made more efficient by adding a boolean flag to detect if any swap was made during an iteration, and if not, the loop can be terminated early, as no more swaps are needed.

Overall, great job on the implementation and passing all test cases! Keep up the good work.

2. Task 2 

Great job on writing the code for insertion sort algorithm! 

The implementation looks good and the code runs without any errors. The logic you used to sort the array is also correct. However, you can improve your code by adding a check to ensure that the input array is not null or undefined, as the current implementation does not handle such cases.
