# String Algorithm Problems in JS

## Question 1 - Finding Substring

> How can you check if a substring exists in a string? (How to implement the `indexOf()` function?)

1. Part 1 - Create outer loop
2. Part 2 - Create inner loop
3. Part 3 - Optimization

In Part 2 step, we need to create an inner loop that would help us in checking if the next few letters (including the current letter) matched with the inner loop.

```javascript
originalString = "Hello"
targetString = "lo"

for (let i = 0; i < originalString.length; i++) {
  // Leave for Step 2
  for (let j = 0; j < targetString.length; j++) {
    // Case 1: Not Match, and end this iteration
    if (originalString[i + j] !== targetString[j]) {
      break;
  }
  // Case 2: Match and itâ€™s the last character
  else if (originalString[i + j] === targetString[j] && j === targetString.length -1) {
    console.log("Found at position " + i)
  }
 }
}
```

> (j === targetString.length -1) vs (originalString[i + j] === targetString[j] && j === targetString.length -1)
